# Kick Off Times 

![KO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kickofftimes/kickoff/build/app/webroot/img/src/png/favicon-144.png)

This is for the main website to promote and support the Kick Off Times open-source project.

## What is this? 🤷‍♂️

Simplest explanation is as follows:

 * _MLP_ - **Template** - simple website to display sports events from a data source (JSON data, possibly from API)
 * _Stage 2_ - **Website** - promotional content site to explain this in greater detail and how to get involved
 * _Stage 3_ - **API** - provides structured data for sports events
 * _Stage 4_ - **App** - tool to manage sports event data in the API

Main objective is to **create a community to build the codebase(s) and instructions to create real world examples**.

This will be published on [kickofftimes.app](https://kickofftimes.app)

## Help out! 💁‍♂️

We're looking for Web engineers, designers, techies and fans of sport to help build Kickoff Times out, work out a sensible approach to get something to market quick and lay the foundations for something that can scale. 

The aim is to get the first template ready for Rugby World Cup in September 2019.
